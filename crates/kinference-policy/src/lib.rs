//! CRD-driven routing policy (`kinference.buoyant.io/v1alpha1`).
//!
//! When a `Pick` names an `InferencePool`, kinference reads that pool, the
//! `InferencePolicy` it points at, and the destinations it lists, and routes
//! accordingly. A `Pick` with no pool is unaffected.
//!
//! A policy does not override `PredictorConfig` or `PickerConfig`, which come
//! from the worker set's TOML `[[profile]]`. It governs the layer above the
//! picker: which candidates exist, which are dropped, and how survivors are
//! ranked.
//!
//! There are two kinds of destination:
//!
//! - An `InferenceWorkerSet` is a pool. It carries its own `serviceRef`, ports,
//!   `kvBlockSize` and `profile`, and resolves by `(namespace, name)` against
//!   the live pool set.
//! - An `InferenceProvider` lives outside the cluster. It resolves to a
//!   `GatewayBackend` reference, a wire format and a declared model table, and
//!   the caller of `Pick` dials it. kinference never reads that backend, so
//!   what it knows about the provider's health comes from the caller (see
//!   [`provider_health`]).
//!
//! This crate holds the resource types and everything that can be computed
//! without a cluster. `kinfctl` builds on it, and the router re-exports it as
//! its `policy` module, alongside the watchers and status writers.
//!
//! - [`crd`]: the resource types. `charts/kinference-crds/templates/*.yaml` is
//!   the source of truth.
//! - `predicate`: the predicate grammar, compiled to a typed AST once per
//!   policy revision.
//! - `compile`: `InferencePolicy` to `CompiledPolicy`, collecting warnings.
//! - `classify`: the classifier registry and the tags each request carries.
//! - `engine`: candidate generation, exclusion, selection.
//! - `explain`: a rendered trace of what `engine` decided and why.
//! - `resolve`: the CRDs to the resolved snapshot, as a pure function.
//! - `services`: the router's view of `Service`s, for port numbers.
//! - `rejection`: why a worker set produced no pool.
//! - `provider_health`: what callers report about off-cluster destinations.
//! - `lint` and `warning`: name checks against the pools a policy serves, and
//!   the warnings they and `compile` produce.
//! - `check`: validation of manifests before they are applied, behind
//!   `kinfctl check`.

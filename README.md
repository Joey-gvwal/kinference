# Kinference

🎈 Welcome to Kinference! 👋

Kinference is an inference _control plane_ for Kubernetes and vLLM.

At its core, Kinference selects among inference endpoints, applying policies,
routing, and load balancing as appropriate. It exposes a gRPC interface that
takes an inference request (e.g. in OpenAI chat-completions format) and returns
the endpoint for that request, as well as the appropriate-mutated body.

To do this, Kinference monitors vLLM KV-cache events and engine metrics.
Kinference currently uses NVIDIA's
[dynamo-kv-router](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo) crate to handle cache
events.

Kinference also monitors and sets the status on a set of Kubernetes CRDs that
configure its behavior.

Kinference is designed to be paired with a proxy. For example, it pairs with the
[Buoyant Gateway](https://github.com/BuoyantIO/gateway/).

## Quick start

See [the Kinference getting started
guide](https://kinference.ai/docs/getting-started/).

## Documentation

- [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md): Overall project architecture.
- [Request flow](docs/request-flow.md): How requests flow through the system as
  a whole.
- [Local development](docs/local-development.md): How to build, install, and run
  locally.
- [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md): How to contribute the project.

## CRDs

Kinference primarily uses Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) for
configuration. The CRD schemas are in
[charts/kinference-crds](charts/kinference-crds/templates). See [the Kinference
CRD reference docs](https://kinference.ai/docs/reference/crds/) for documentation.

## kinfctl

This repo includes a `kinfctl` CLI tool. This CLI is designed to make it easy
for you (or your agents) to validate policies before sending them to the server.
See [the Kinference kinfctl reference](https://kinference.ai/docs/reference/kinfctl/)
for more.

To build the CLI from source, run `just install-cli`.

## Known limitations

Kinference is alpha software. It has not seen sustained production exposure. Run
at your own risk.

The current Kinference implementation lacks several features that are in the
full scope of the project, including:

* Support for /v1/messages (Anthropic-style calls)
* Rate limiting
* Semantic classifiers
* Support for multiple replicas

These will be addressed shortly.

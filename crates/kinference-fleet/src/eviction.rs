//! Worker eviction signaling.
//!
//! A worker is torn down when discovery removes it, or on a homogeneity
//! violation: ingest sees a block size other than the pool's, or the metrics
//! poller sees a `/v1/models` list that disagrees with the pool's canonical
//! set.
//!
//! The ingest listener and metrics poller request eviction by sending an
//! [`EvictionRequest`]; `fleet::coordinator` owns the receiver and does the
//! teardown, keeping lifecycle logic in one place.
